## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character receives a mundane object from a ghost, charged with a specific, unspoken memory.
- Create a conversation between a dying elder and a restless ancestor, mediated by a skeptical younger family member.
- Describe a journey through a modern Asian city where the protagonist sees literal 'ghosts' of its colonial past in the architecture and street life.
- Craft a myth where the River of Forgetfulness requires a photograph as the toll for passage, instead of a coin.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive website where users can 'develop' a ghostly image by hovering over different parts of a photographic negative.
- Create a text generator that blends Vietnamese poetic forms (like lục bát) with descriptions of photographic development chemicals and processes.
