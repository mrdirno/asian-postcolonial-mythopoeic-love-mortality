  "cover_prompt": "A spectral woman, her form woven from swirling river water and old photographic silver, reaches a translucent hand towards a living photographer who holds a large-format camera, their connection forming a bridge between worlds on a misty riverbank at dusk. The scene is set where a colonial-era pier meets a dark, slow-moving tropical river, with ghostly negatives of forgotten ancestors floating like water lilies and the roots of ancient banyan trees cradling old, submerged camera parts, all under a sky the color of a faded cyanotype. In the profoundly atmospheric and mythic style of Zdzisław Beksiński's haunting surrealism and the melancholic, layered storytelling of Gregory Crewdson's photographic tableaux, evoking a sense of deep, inherited memory. Book cover framing, centered and symmetrical composition with a low, dramatic angle looking up slightly at the two figures, emphasizing the river as a vast, reflective plane. Ethereal, volumetric lighting cuts through the mist with a cool, moonlight temperature, contrasting with the warm, amber glow emanating from the key hanging from the photographer's neck, using a palette of desaturated blues, silvers, and deep blacks punctuated by sepia and gold. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
